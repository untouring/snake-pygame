A classical Snake game with audio.

Yeah, I decided to add the famous sound track to my lil' project. I don't own this track. All rights belong to its owner!!! I created a non-commercial little project. This project isn't meant to be used for commercial purposes. So if you want to repeat or use this project, please, make sure that you'd end up using it as a non-commercial little fun game or a source to learn something new.

Cheers!
